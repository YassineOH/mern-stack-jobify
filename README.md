# MERN stack app - jobify

This project is a course presented by Mr [Mr John Simlga](https://www.udemy.com/user/janis-smilga-3/) on Udemy platform.<br/>
The main difference between the course code and mine is the following points:
  
  + I used Typescript instead of javascript to code the front end.<br/>
  + I add an <b>Auth workflow</b> to the register process using SendGrid API to verify the user account.
